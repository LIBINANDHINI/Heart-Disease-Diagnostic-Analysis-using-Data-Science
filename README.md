# Problem Statement 
Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all
irrespective of any status. You are required to analyze this health and medical data for better
future preparation.

Do ETL: Extract- Transform and Load data from the heart disease diagnostic database

# Conclusion
