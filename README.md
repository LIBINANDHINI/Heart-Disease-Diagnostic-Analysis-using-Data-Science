# Problem Statement 
Health is real wealth in the pandemic time we all realized the brute effects of covid-19 on all
irrespective of any status. You are required to analyze this health and medical data for better
future preparation.

Do ETL: Extract- Transform and Load data from the heart disease diagnostic database
You can perform EDA through python. The database extracts various information such as
Heart disease rates, Heart disease by gender, by age.

You can even compare attributes of the data set to extract necessary information. Make the

9. Higher Cholestrol Level and Higher Blood Pressure Level  causes Chances Of Heart Disease
